# GeneticAlgorithm
Genetic algorithm performed over a population of floats, ints and bools.The algorithm is performed over multiple generations until reaching a perfect solution.

The algorithm uses a mix of mutation and crossover when iterating through generations. Weak individuals are eleminated quicker while strong ones survive.

The project is written in C++
